#BITCOIN MINING NODE SIMULATION
 		 
Please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/cbaumler/cpre588_project/wiki) for complete documentation.

This project explores some of the technological challenges related to cryptocurrencies, using Electronic System Level (ESL) modeling techniques, focusing on speed and power estimation to assist developers in making decisions regarding component selection. The project describes the modeling of a complete mining "node", involving multiple processing elements and specialized hardware. Speed and power estimation techniques are employed to compare several devices to host a hashing algorithm, including general purpose processors, FPGAs, and ASICs.
